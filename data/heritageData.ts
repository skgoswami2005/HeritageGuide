The **Delhi Gate** is one of the three main gates of the Red Fort in Delhi, India. It is located at the southern end of the fort and served as a secondary entrance, primarily used by the public. Here's a detailed overview of this historical gate:

## **History and Construction**
- The Delhi Gate was built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who commissioned the construction of the Red Fort in 1638. The fort was completed in 1648, and the gate was part of this grand architectural project[1][2].
- The gate's design is similar to the **Lahori Gate**, with square, rectangular, and ornate decorations, reflecting the Indo-Islamic architectural style prevalent during the Mughal era[2].

## **Significance and Use**
- The Delhi Gate was used by the emperor to travel to the **Jama Masjid** for prayers. It is situated in the southwest corner of the fort, making it a convenient exit for this purpose[8].
- Unlike the **Lahori Gate**, which is more famous for its association with India's Independence Day celebrations, the Delhi Gate was not as prominent in historical events but played a crucial role in the daily life of the fort's inhabitants[1][2].

## **Architecture and Design**
- The gate's architecture is characterized by its robust structure, which was designed to provide security while also serving as an impressive entrance to the fort.

## **Current Status**
- Today, the Delhi Gate remains an integral part of the Red Fort complex, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007[1][3].
- Visitors can explore the gate as part of their tour of the Red Fort, appreciating its historical significance and architectural beauty.

In summary, the Delhi Gate is a testament to the Mughal architectural prowess and serves as a lesser-known but important entrance to the Red Fort, highlighting the blend of functionality and aesthetics that defined Mughal architecture.

      `
The **Moti Masjid**, or **Pearl Mosque**, is a historical mosque located within the Red Fort complex in Delhi, India. Built during the Mughal era, it is renowned for its architectural beauty and significance.

## **Historical Background**
- **Commissioned by Aurangzeb**: The Moti Masjid was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb shortly after his accession to the throne. Construction began in 1659 and was completed in 1663, with Aurangzeb personally financing the project at a cost of 1 lakh and 60 thousand rupees.
- **Purpose**: The mosque was built to serve as a private place of worship for the emperor, providing him with a space for prayer close to his private chambers within the Red Fort. At that time, the fort did not have an existing mosque, as Shah Jahan, the fort's builder, had preferred to pray at the nearby Jama Masjid.

## **Architectural Features**
- **Design**: The Moti Masjid is constructed primarily from white marble, which gives it a striking appearance. The mosque features three domes and is adorned with intricate floral carvings that exemplify Mughal artistry.
- **Dimensions**: The mosque measures approximately 9 by 15 meters (30 by 49 feet), making it relatively small compared to other mosques of the time.
- **Interior**: Although not open for worship today, the interior originally included a prayer hall with beautifully decorated ceilings and walls.

## **Cultural Significance**
- **Ceremonial Use**: Following its completion, Aurangzeb began to offer *zuhr* (noon) prayers at this mosque with state officials, establishing a new ceremonial practice within the fort.
- **Historical Events**: The Moti Masjid witnessed significant events during the British capture of Delhi in 1857. British soldiers looted the mosque and stripped its gilded copper domes, leading to deterioration of its structure over time.

## **Restoration and Current Status**
- After suffering damage during the British occupation, restoration efforts were made to preserve the mosque. The original domes were replaced with white marble to restore its aesthetic appeal.
- Today, the Moti Masjid is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and is no longer open for worship. Instead, it serves as a preserved historical site within the Red Fort complex.

The Moti Masjid stands as an important example of Mughal architecture during Aurangzeb's reign and continues to attract visitors interested in India's rich cultural heritage. Its elegant design and historical significance contribute to its status as a notable landmark within the Red Fort.
